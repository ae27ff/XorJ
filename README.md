# XorJ
Java multi-file binary XOR utility with a Swing UI.



# Downloading the Program pre-built
You can find released JARs which you can run on the [Releases tab](https://github.com/crashdemons/XorJ/releases) of this project.

If you want something a bit more shiny, you can check out our [development builds](https://ci.meme.tips/job/XorJ/) available through Jenkins CI.

# Running the Program
On Windows, if you have Java SE/JRE installed, you can usually just double-click the JAR file to run it as a program.

On linux and Windows, if you have OpenJDK or your relevant java package installed, you can run `javaw -jar path-to-the-jarfile-here` in order to run the program.

*Note: Version 1.4+ requires Java 7 or higher, version 1.5+ requires Java 8.*

# Building the Project yourself
We've recently moved to using Maven! If you used build.xml or a Netbeans Project before, you may need to import the project again as a maven project / from existing POM.

[This document](https://github.com/crashdemons/Notes/blob/master/Importing_Maven_Projects.md) may help you import the project in your IDE.
